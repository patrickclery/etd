# Evernoting Things Done

_ETD_ is [my](https://github.com/patrickclery) implementation of David Allen's _Getting Things Done_ system  across MacOS, Evernote, & extending to mobile devices.

## PRE-REQUISITES

- Install [Evernote Web Clipper](https://evernote.com/features/webclipper) for your browser. Set the default folder to `INBOX`
- Connect Evernote to [Cronofy](https://www.cronofy.com/) - This will sync your google reminders 

## CAPTURING:

### IDEAS

1. Press `^⌘N` _(from anywhere in MacOS)_ to create a New Note
2. Press `⌘’` _(focus tags)_ & enter `#<project name>` as the Note Tag and hit `↵`
3. Press `⌘L` _(focus title)_ & enter the title using specific, clear, actionable language.
4. Press `⇥` to focus the Note Body and begin typing.

#### Notes

* Anything that takes more than one action, becomes its own Project
* Important Evernote keyboard shortcuts:
    * `^⌥⌘N` - Anytime you have an idea immediately dump it with `^⌥⌘N` to create a new note.
    * `^⌘E` - Search evernote
    * `^⌘V` - paste to Evernote
    * `^⌘C` - capture rectangular screenshot

### IDEAS (on the go)

1. On the go, the [Apple Watch](https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch) can capture Evernote voice records directly from the main screen in a single touch. 

### ARTICLES

1.  Within your browser, click the `Evernote Web Clipper` icon, then save to your `INBOX`.

### IMAGES

1.  Right-click the image and `Evernote Web Clipper` → `Clip image` to send it to your `INBOX`

### SCREENSHOTS & PARTIAL SCREENSHOTS

1.  Hit `^⌘C` Right-click the image and `Evernote Web Clipper` → `Clip image` to send it to your `INBOX`

### PHYSICAL DOCUMENTS

I use [this printer](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07C5DQ6NQ/) that has Evernote integration with two settings:

    1. `Evernote (Low Res)` - I use this for most, it  
    2. `Evernote (High Res)` - For scanning documents where scan quality is important
 
Then I shred every document using [this shredder](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00HFJWKWK/).

#### NOTES
 
- Evernote Web Clipper does have its own keyboard shortcuts, though since they interfere with another add-on my browser uses (_Vim Vixen_) I generally just use the mouse to save articles.

## PROCESSING

- Each action must belong to a project.
- Each project belongs in the `PROJECTS` stack.
- Set _location-specific reminders_ using Apple’s location-based reminders
- if it’s Amazon, add it to your cart/wishlist (via Alexa is often best: “Alexa, add ______ to my shopping cart"
- If it’s not actionable right now, set a reminder (so you don't forget) and mark it as Waiting
    - (Using your mouse cursor) Click the three dots in the top-right corner of the Note Window and select Add Reminder…
    - Choose a date or click Tomorrow
    - Press `^⌘M` then choose the _WAITING folder
- Anything that removes you one step away from the Evernote UI is likely to add more complexity to this system. In my experience, the biggest enemy of using a day-to-day note-taking or organizational system is if it makes your life MORE complex and not less complex. When you have to check multiple websites/apps to get info, that’s when things (in my experience) have broken.

## How to Create A New Project (Evernote)

1. Press `⇧⌘N` to create a New Notebook
2. Enter #project name as the Notebook Name and hit `↵`
3. (Using your mouse cursor) Click & drag the project into the Projects notebook
4. Press `⌘L` and enter a clear & concise Note Title
5. Press `⇥` to focus the Note Body and begin typing

### Naming Rules

* Projects start with a #. e.g: #home renovations (spaces are OK).
* Project Files go into their own Project Files folder, then immediately add it to shortcuts (`⇧⌘8`).
* Every item in your Project Notebook must be a single actionable item, i.e: “Take out the garbage". If it’s a reference, just include it in the body of your Project Note or put it somewhere external and link from within the Project Note. This way you can easily look at your project’s Notebook and see the list of remaining actions.

### CREATING PROJECT FILES:

1. Press `⌘N` to create a New Note (note: anywhere within MacOS you can create a note by pressing `^⌥⌘N`)
2. Press `⌘L` to select the Note Title and enter #<Project Name> (prefix with hashtag)
3. `^⌘M` - Move the note to the Project Files notebook
4. `⇧⌘8` - Add the Project File to the shortcuts menu

### Naming Rules

* Projects start with a #. e.g: #home renovations (spaces are OK).
* Project Files go into their own Project Files folder, then immediately add it to shortcuts (`⇧⌘8`).
* Every item in your Project Notebook must be a single actionable item, i.e: “Take out the garbage". If it’s a reference, just include it in the body of your Project Note or put it somewhere external and link from within the Project Note. This way you can easily look at your project’s Notebook and see the list of remaining actions.

### Creating a new Project:

* `^⌥⌘N`
* Press `⌘’ `and type #project name as the Note Tag and hit `↵`
* Press `⌘L` and type #project name as the Note Title
* Press `⇥` to focus the Note Body

## KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS

* `⌘J` - Search everything: searches notebook names, note titles, note bodies, etc. I use this to navigate around Evernote, rather than Tabbing or reaching for my mouse when I have to change Notes/Notebooks.
* `^⌥⌘C` - Copy a note link for the current note in view. After copying, you can paste the link within another note. Usually I’ll do this if I create a resource in Evernote (for examples a PDF) then I’ll link to it under a heading such as “Related Documents” from within a Project Note.
* Markdown text is converted on the fly. So you can type things like “[ ]” and it will automatically be replaced with []. 
* `⌘L` - Focus the Title text input
* `⌘’` - Focus the tags text input
* `^⌘M` - Move the note to another notebook
* Evernote's editor’s basic formatting shortcuts `^⌘H` is highlight text, `⌘B` is Bold, `⌘U` is underline, `⌘I` is Italics, (see Format > Style in the menubar for the rest)

## OTHER TOOLS

- [Adiós.ai](https://adios.ai/) allows you to schedule your emails to arrive when you want. Mine is set to receive my first emails of the day @ 12pm, then every hour from 3pm-10pm. Limiting your exposure to incoming email allows you to deal with your tasks, then handle all PROCESSING when at once later.
