# Evernoting Things Done

_ETD_ is [my](https://github.com/patrickclery) implementation of David Allen's _Getting Things Done_ system  across MacOS, Evernote, & extending to mobile devices.

### Integrations:
* Alfred - Alfred Evernote workflow search from within MacOS using with `^⌘␣` (the ␣ is a spacebar) then type ens <search term>
* Cronofy - Syncing to Google Cal

## How to Create A New Project

### 1. Create a Project Notebook

* (Open the Evernote window in MacOS)
1. Press `⇧⌘N` to create a New Notebook
2. Enter #project name as the Notebook Name and hit `↵`
3. (Using your mouse cursor) Click & drag the project into the Projects notebook
4. Press `⌘L` and enter a clear & concise Note Title
5. Press `⇥` to focus the Note Body and begin typing

### 2. Create a project file:

1. Press `⌘N` to create a New Note (note: anywhere within MacOS you can create a note by pressing `^⌥⌘N`)
2. Press `⌘L` to select the Note Title and enter #<Project Name> (prefix with hashtag)
3. `^⌘M` - Move the note to the Project Files notebook
4. `⇧⌘8` - Add the Project File to the shortcuts menu

### 3. Creating a new task:

* (Open the Evernote window)
* Press `⌘N` to create a New Note (note: anywhere within MacOS you can create a note by pressing `^⌥⌘N`)
* Press `⌘’` and enter #project name as the Note Tag and hit ↵
* Press `⌘L` and enter a clear & concise Note Title
* Press `⇥` to focus the Note Body and begin typing

## Capturing:

* If it’s location specific, try to use Apple’s location-based reminders
* if it’s Amazon, add it to your cart/wishlist (via Alexa is often best: “Alexa, add ______ to my shopping cart"
* If it’s not actionable right now, set a reminder and mark it as Waiting
    * (Using your mouse cursor) Click the three dots in the top-right corner of the Note Window and select Add Reminder…
    * Choose a date or click Tomorrow
    * Press `^⌘M` then choose the _WAITING folder
* I use a printer that has Evernote integration - Any paper I get gets scanned, uploaded to my Evernote scans, & shredded.
* When I’m away from my computer, I use my Apple Watch’s Evernote app to capture voice recordings of ideas. To capture documents, photos, etc. I’ll use my camera, & save it to Evernote’s inbox to process later.
* Anything that removes you one step away from the Evernote UI is likely to add more complexity to this system. In my experience, the biggest enemy of using a day-to-day note-taking or organizational system is if it makes your life MORE complex and not less complex. When you have to check multiple websites/apps to get info, that’s when things (in my experience) have broken.


### Within MacOS

* Here are the important shortcuts you’ll become familiar with:
    * `^⌥⌘N` - Anytime you have an idea immediately dump it with `^⌥⌘N` to create a new note.
    * `^⌘E` - Search evernote
    * `^⌘V` - paste to Evernote

## Processing Inbox:

* Projects start with a #. e.g: #home renovations (spaces are OK).
* Project Files go into their own Project Files folder, then immediately add it to shortcuts (`⇧⌘8`).
* Every item in your Project Notebook must be a single actionable item, i.e: “Take out the garbage". If it’s a reference, just include it in the body of your Project Note or put it somewhere external and link from within the Project Note. This way you can easily look at your project’s Notebook and see the list of remaining actions.
* If your system is too complex, dumb it down enough so everything fits into Evernote. If you run into anything too complex, like media that is unsupported by Evernote or some really cool Widget you want to use in your Productivity, you can link to it …BUT, first ask yourself if you can get by without it. 

### Creating a new Project:

* `^⌥⌘N`
* Press `⌘’ `and type #project name as the Note Tag and hit `↵`
* Press `⌘L` and type #project name as the Note Title
* Press `⇥` to focus the Note Body

## Shortcuts:

* `⌘J` - Search everything: searches notebook names, note titles, note bodies, etc. I use this to navigate around Evernote, rather than Tabbing or reaching for my mouse when I have to change Notes/Notebooks.
    * `^⌥⌘C` - Copy a note link for the current note in view. After copying, you can paste the link within another note. Usually I’ll do this if I create a resource in Evernote (for examples a PDF) then I’ll link to it under a heading such as “Related Documents” from within a Project Note.
    * Markdown text is converted on the fly. So you can type things like “[ ]” and it will automatically be replaced with []. 
    * `⌘L` - Focus the Title text input
    * `⌘’` - Focus the tags text input
    * `^⌘M` - Move the note to another notebook
    * Evernote's editor’s basic formatting shortcuts `^⌘H` is highlight text, `⌘B` is Bold, `⌘U` is underline, `⌘I` is Italics, (see Format > Style in the menubar for the rest)
